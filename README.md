# Malaria-prediction
In this project our objective was to predict whether a person has malaria (parasitic) or not (un-infected) based on given image dataset, I have followed all the steps from data gathering to model deployment, at first I used some of the most popular pre-trained neural networks (Resnet50, VGG16, VGG19 etc.) and compared them using the "validation accuracy" metric, what I found that out of all the neural networks most of them were giving me 'val_accuracy' around 85-86% in comparison to VGG19 which was giving me 'val_accuracy' somewhere around 86-87%, so in this module I have used the VGG19 neural network to predict whether a person has malaria or not using the given image and then tried some different sets of values to increase my model's "val_accuracy" upto 89.55%.
